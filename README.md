# Music-Recommender-Engine-KNN

This notebook uses a kaggle dataset - [Spotify Dataset 1921-2020, 160k+ Tracks](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) 

The "data.csv" file contains more than 160.000 songs collected from Spotify Web API whose primary key is represented by an ID generated by the Spotify API.

This notebook uses K-Nearest-Neighbors to recommend N other tracks based on the input track.

### Observations

It is observed that for a given input data, the output is always the same for that input data. This can be due to the model comparing the features of the input track and suggesting tracks having similar features. There is no user data taken into consideration to personalize the results to match the user's preferences.
